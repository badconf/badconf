# Hello

I'm an Infrastructure Solutions Architect with a passion for technology and innovation. My daily work involves designing and implementing robust infrastructure solutions that power businesses and drive success.

## What I Do

- **Design**: Crafting comprehensive infrastructure solutions tailored to specific needs.
- **Implement**: Turning design ideas into functional, efficient, and scalable systems.
- **Code**: Although an architect, I occasionally delve into coding, creating personal tools and scripts.
- **Write**: I wrote my first ebook about privacy, published [here](https://www.zelib.org).

## On GitHub

Here on my personal GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of code files and projects that I've developed for personal use. These might include:

- Scripts to automate stuff
- Web pages with elegant typography
- Experimenting with new technologies and frameworks

I used to program in Perl in the past for system scripts and web applications with CGI. Now I move to Go for many reasons.

## Open Source Philosophy

Since 1997 I strongly believe in the power of sharing and collaboration. My open source philosophy drives me to share some of my personal work here on GitHub. But I'm not a professional developer :)

I'm not looking for contribution, except explicit mention for it. I just share what I write or code for my personal use. Feel free to fork.
