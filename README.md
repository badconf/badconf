# Hello

I'm a Solutions Architect with a passion for technology and innovation. My daily work involves designing and implementing robust solutions that power businesses and drive success.

## What I Do

- **Design**: Crafting comprehensive systems tailored to specific needs.
- **Implement**: Turning design ideas into functional, efficient, and scalable systems.
- **Code**: Although an architect, I occasionally delve into coding, creating personal tools and scripts.
- **Write**: I wrote my first ebook about privacy, published [here](https://architext.org). Another one is coming.

## On GitHub

Here on my personal GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of content. These might include:

- Some code for stuff
- Web pages with elegant typography
- Lists of resources

## Open Source Philosophy

Since 1997 I strongly believe in the power of sharing and collaboration. My open source philosophy drives me to share some of my personal work here on GitHub. But I'm not a professional developer :)

I'm not looking for contribution, except explicit mention for it. I just share what I write or code for my personal use. Feel free to fork.
